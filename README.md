# `::inline_proc_macros`

Hack to implement inline procedural macros,
forked off [https://github.com/mystor/ctrs].

Requires the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target to be installed (or `rustup`,
since it can use the latter to install the former when missing).

**note** Quite experimental!

## Example

See the [`downstream/` directory](https://github.com/danielhenrymantilla/rust-inline_proc_macros/tree/proc-macro-approach/downstream).
